conversions i must do: cspdiuxX%

c - char
s - string
p - pointer in hexalower
d & i - signed int
u - unsigned int
x - unsigned lowercase hexadecimal
X - unsigned uppercase hexadecimal
% - just a %

flags i must do: -0.* 
I also must do minumum field

Printf conversion structure

%[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier

flags

    - - left align the output
    0 - fills pading with 0s instead of ' '. Does not work with s conversion. ignored if there is a - flag.


width

    number - (must not begin with 0) the minumum number of chars to be printed. if the string is shorter pad to the right with ' '
    * - the number is in an argument before the actual argument instead of in the string
    Both cases always print evrything if the value to be printed is bigger

.persision

    .number     - for d,i,u,x,X minimum number of digits to be printed. pad with 0s to the left.
                if the value is 0 and persision is 0 print nothing
                - for s the maximum number of chars to be printed
                if no value is given after the . assume 0
    .*       see width *
